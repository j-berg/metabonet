instead find top 10-25 clusters with overlap threshold of at least 0.5 (give plenty of flexibility).
select clusters that are small with both accumulation and depletion

use maximum search depth of 2

search top 25 clusters X 3 at overlap thresholds of 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75

prioritize clusters
Write these selection criteria in the methods section...

1. 1-3 reactions
2. measurements for majority of metabolites
3. both accumulation and depletion of metabolites (to infer functionality)
4. significant measurements

Include metabolites that are relevant for context regardless of their measurement status.
If a metabolite isn't necessary for context, only include if p-value < 0.25.


steps

1. define custom metabolic network in MetaboNet

2. import metabolic network into Cytoscape
- File -> Import -> Network from file
- file "network_cytoscape.json"
- file does not integrate measurements with node attributes

3. specify styles for visualization of global networks
- File -> Import -> Styles from File
- file "cytoscape/style_network.xml"

4. calculate layout for global network
- Compound Spring Embedder (CoSE)
"Layout quality:" = "Proof"
"Incremental:" = "False"
"Ideal edge length:" = "500"
"Spring strength (0-100):" = "10"
"Repulsion strength (0-100):" = "10000"
"Gravity strength (0-100):" = "1"
"Compound gravity strength (0-100):" = "1"
"Gravity range (0-100):" = "100"
"Compound gravity range (0-100):" = "100"
"Use smart edge length calculation:" = "True"
"Use smart repulsion range calculation:" = "True"

4. integrate measurements to candidate metabolites in MetaboNet

5. import metabolite measurements into Cytoscape
- File -> Import -> Table from File
- file "measurement/metabolites.tsv"
- table of fold changes and probabilities from all studies
- match fold changes and probabilities from all studies to metabolites' nodes

6. specify styles for visualization of measurements
- File -> Import -> Styles from File
- file "cytoscape/styles_measurements.xml"
- each study has its own styles
- each study has its own minimal and maximal log-2 fold changes

7. explore clusters of measurements by jActiveModules
7.1. select all metabolites' nodes in network in Cytoscape
- "type:metabolite"
7.2. detect clusters using jActiveModules application in Cytoscape
- detect clusters by enrichment of probabilities (p-values)
-"number of modules" 5-25
-"overlap threshold" 0.25, 0.50, or 0.75
-"adjust score for size" True
-"regional scoring" True
-"strategy" search
-"search depth" 2 (bipartite network)
-"max depth" 2 (bipartite network)
-"search from selected nodes" True... select metabolite nodes

8. visualize specific clusters of interest
- query for list of nodes in cluster
-- "entity:MNXM189, entity:R169F9B7A, entity:MNXM126, entity:R61E25419, entity:MNXM892"
- hide all but selected nodes
- apply compound spring embedder layout
- Compound Spring Embedder (CoSE)
"Layout quality:" = "Default"
"Incremental:" = "False"
"Ideal edge length:" = "100"
"Spring strength (0-100):" = "10"
"Repulsion strength (0-100):" = "50"
"Gravity strength (0-100):" = "10"
"Compound gravity strength (0-100):" = "10"
"Gravity range (0-100):" = "10"
"Compound gravity range (0-100):" = "10"
"Use smart edge length calculation:" = "True"
"Use smart repulsion range calculation:" = "True"
